pppd can easily be used to create a tunnel through an SSH server:

```
# pppd updetach noauth silent nodeflate pty "/usr/bin/ssh root@remote-gw /usr/sbin/pppd nodetach notty noauth" ipparam vpn 10.0.0.8:10.0.0.9
```

add a iptables rule:
```
# iptables -t nat -O POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j SNAT --to-source 10.0.0.8
```

When the VPN is established, you can route traffic through it. To get access to an internal network:
```
# ip route add 192.168.0.0/16 via 10.0.0.8
```

To route all Internet traffic through the tunnel, for example, to protect your communication on an unencrypted network, first add a route to the SSH server through your regular gateway:
```
# ip route add <remote-gw> via <current default gateway>
```

Next, replace the default route with the tunnel
```
# ip route replace default via 10.0.0.8
```
